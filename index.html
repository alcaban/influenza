                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Influenza, also known as the “flu,” is categorized as an infection in the respiratory tract system that causes the influenza virus. Unlike other types of respiratory illnesses, such as the flu, influenza is known to cause an increased chance of being susceptible to more severe illnesses. Influenza is normally divided into three different types:
                                    Type A, Type B, and Type C. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Influenza types A and B are more commonly known to be the culprit behind widespread epidemics of respiratory illness, usually resulting in hospitalization or even death. Type C usually causes mild or asymptomatic cases of influenza. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Typical cases of influenza normally cause symptoms that range from: Fever, sore throat/severe cough, stuffed or runny nose, fatigue (including muscle fatigue), and moderate to extreme headaches. More rarely (although occurring more often in children you could also experience): Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Transmission occurs rapidly, especially in crowded areas. When someone infected with influenza coughs or sneezes, the released droplets disperse in the air and can affect people nearby. The incubation period is about two days long but can range from one to four days. Seasonal influenza epidemics can occur more often during winter (since most people are inside more often, it allows viruses to spread easier from person to person, especially coupled with the climate, which already weakens resistance to viruses).
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    One of the worst instances of an influenza epidemic was in 1917, claiming millions of lives and disabling countless others. Much like COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes influenza frequently mutates, so vaccinations against influenza are critical, particularly for babies and small children, immunocompromised people, pregnant people, and those with other health risks that the flu may exacerbate.

                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50"> This map indicates the spatial distribution of locations where Chicagoans can receive a free flu vaccine. It ranges from 2014 to 2023. Note that, upon zooming in closer to the map, the concentration of locations begins to disperse, with many being concentrated closer to the lake. There is a lower frequency of locations the further south and west one gets from the city. 
                    Another additional note to consider is that the interactive map above does not pinpoint locations but rather aggregated points of how frequently flu vaccine locations occur in the city. The further you zoom into the map, the more you can see individual locations (hence the more vibrant red you may see).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    When comparing the heat map with the choropleth map, it should be no surprise that people living in the South and West Sides are much more likely to contract influenza. This follows a standard geospatial pattern in Chicago. Statistically, there are inequities in healthcare access across the city. Such a pattern is replicated nationwide.

                     <p class="mb-0 text-white-50"> Particularly concerning is that similar to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the flu virus is constantly mutating and becoming vaccine-resistant. Many Chicagoans are at higher risk of contracting influenza and spreading it to others without proper prevention measures
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Annually, flu season in Chicago starts in October and does not end until around April. The winter months are particularly dangerous, as the holiday season means more people are spending time indoors with potentially infected or asymptomatic people.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is important to make equitable changes in the availability of vaccines and locations to get a vaccine. Decreasing the susceptibility to contracting influenza is directly tied to how easy it is for people in the city to get vaccinated. Healthcare is just one aspect of assessing geospatial inequities within Chicago and globally. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Influenza has been known as a historically significant cause of hospitalization among high-risk groups, in more severe cases leading to pneumonia, sepsis, and death. Since the first influenza epidemic in 1918, doctors and other health experts have emphasized the importance of prevention. This includes washing one’s hands frequently, covering one’s mouth when coughing or sneezing, and staying home if one is sick.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                    Most cases are challenging to diagnose since many symptoms can be confused with other respiratory viruses. Hence, prevention is critical to reducing the number of people susceptible to the spread of influenza. Vaccination, as mentioned above, is key to reducing the cases of influenza before they even occur.“Safe and effective vaccines have been used for over 60 years.

As evidenced by the above maps, there are clear disparities in where flu vaccine locations are in Chicago. Those without reliable transportation, access to insurance, are low-income, or struggling with houselessness are undoubtedly at higher risk for repeatedly contracting influenza. Even a person who is perfectly healthy can contract serious health conditions during and following a flu infection. Treating the flu as a serious disease that contributes to ongoing health crises, both within the United States and beyond, is critical. Repeat infections are not ideal with other upper respiratory and viral diseases. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There are multiple ways to encourage people to get their flu vaccines, and marketing should be ramped up, particularly during flu season. Annual flu shots mean less frequent infections and less intense flu seasons. Community responsibility to one another and more robust public health measures to create a more equitable distribution of vaccines can prevent a disastrous flu season.
